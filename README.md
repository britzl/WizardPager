Wizard Pager is a library that provides an example implementation of a Wizard UI on Android, it's based of Roman Nurik's wizard pager (https://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/browse/misc/wizardpager)

I've updated Roman's code to use the latest support library, it is now structured as a library project, and it's backwards compatible with Android 2.2


Usage
============

There is a sample implementation, so you can see how to add this library to your project. THe example uses ActionBarSherlock so you will need to add that as a dependency on the example project

Developed By
============

* Forked from code by Tech Freak - <tech.freak.blog@gmail.com>
* Based on code by Roman Nurik
* Additions by Bj√∂rn Ritzl (added the Wizard Activity, made the Review page optional and move the app specific CustomerPage to the example)
